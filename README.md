# Xbox Cloud Gaming (Unofficial)
A wrapper for Xbox Cloud Gaming that generates a .apk file that can be installed on Chromecast with Google TV.

## Usage
- Download the .apk file from releases

## Development

### Pre-requisites

### Caveats
- I haven't been able to `npm run build` on Windows 11. Subsystem for Linux (WSL) _might_ be a workaround.
